This extension is adapted from [highlight-words](https://github.com/rsbondi/highlight-words) csatterfield fork, and the sample VS code extension decorator-sample, inspired by atom-quick-highlight.

TO MODIFY in next version:

It creates a decoration for each selected word that appears in all editors. 

# Usage

* You can add words by chosing "Highlight Current" from the command pallet, this will highlight the word at the cursor or the selection.  
* To stop highlighting, choose "Highlight Remove", then the desired word or expression, or all
* You may also remove all from the command "Highlight Remove All" without the prompt for selection
* To highlight using regular expression choose "Highlight Expression" and enter expression(slashes optional, can ignore case with `/expression/i`(g flag is automatic, i flag accepted, all others ignored).  
* To highlight with options choose "Highlight Selection with Options" and choose `whole word`, `ignore case` or `both` when presented
* You can set the mode for "Highlight Current" from the "Set Highlight Mode" command.  The default can be set in the configuration.

# Configuration

The following options can be configured

`highlightwords.colors`: this is an array of light/dark pairs for respective theme types, you can have as few or as many as you like

`highlightwords.box`: show highlights as a box around the selections if true, set highlight as background color if false
